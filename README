This repository is a collection of Jira scripts.  They require jira library.
Install it with

pip install --user jira

All scripts use jiraauth.py as a helper for authentication; that script in turn
expects to find a file at ~/.jira-python/jirashell.ini , with a format like:

[options]
server = https://genymobile.atlassian.net

[basic_auth]
username = afouques
password = (optional)YourPassword

Note that this same config file can be used to run jirashell from jira-python's
tools subdirectory.  jirashell provides an interactive jira client via ipython.
